#Network IP, number of hosts, range of IP addresses and broadcast IP from `193.16.20.35/29` subnet 

###- **NETWORK IP**
From the giving ip address and subnet, `193.16.20` is already part of the network id because `29` is equivalent to `255.255.255.248` which means the first three 255s are used up and part of the netword id already.
Bits calculation:
35 ==>                             0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
4^th^ Octet mask bit of 29 ==>     1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0

Therefore, from the calculation above:
Network ID of `193.16.20.35/29` is `193.16.20.32/29(255.255.255.248)`

###- **NUMBER OF HOST**
To calculate the number of host, the formular to use is 2^32-(cidr-subnet-no)^
32 - 29 =3
Therefore, the total number of host is **8**
While the available number of host is total number of host - 2 which is **6**

###- **RANGE OF IP ADDRESSES**
Using the magic number format, 
From 4^th^ Octet mask bit of 29 ==>     1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0, the magic number is **8**. i.e the decimal value of last ON bit.

`193.16.20.32 - 193.16.20.39` is the range of IP addresses

###- **BROADCAST ID**
`193.16.20.39`
